#6 7 Counter

## Inspiration
We were talking about the 6 7 boba social, when we realized that we 6 7 a lot. We decided to use Mediapipe to track our 6 7'ing by identifying the positions of the elbows and wrists.

## What it does
Every time you 6 7, the counter is updated to reward and keep track of your very important skills. The more you 6 7, the higher you get in the 6 7 universe.

## How we built it
We integrated Mediapipe API and tracked the right elbow, right wrist, left elbow, left wrist, to be able to see when the wrist is above the elbow for each hand, and update the counter that way. We used a pretty standard approach to the React structure, with our CSS invoking a "brainrot" vibe. We also worked on a Live Share, so we have less commits in our Github Repo unfortunately.

## Challenges we ran into
This was not our initial app, it was actually our third pivot. We started the competition by building a server that called Plaid API to make a Jetpack Compose (Android) app that tracked finances. After realizing this project would be incredibly hard, we switched to a web version. After realizing Plaid was not cooperating with us, we pivoted to the 6 7 counter.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the work and effort we made across the entire journey, and the amount of 6 7's we had to execute in order to get the product up and running. We were able to make something out of nothing, and persevere through tough challenges. We also learned new technologies and expanded our horizon.

## What we learned
Everyone got to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and web API's in order to be able to code this web application. We learned new skills, expanded our tech stack horizon by also learning about FastAPI + Railway integrations with Python in our failed app, and we just had fun.

## What's next for 6 7 Counter
We will add more counters and functionalities to making it into a mobile app while fully monitizing our application.

## Built With
React, Mediapipe
